Contains multiple implementations of the Fibonacci function in a recursive way.

- PlainFibonacci: simplest recursive implementation.
- CachedFibonacci: similar to the previous but uses caching mechanism for pruning the recursion tree.
- EfficientCachedFibonacci: similar to the previous but uses a little trick for improving cache memory efficiency.

Reads a text file, determines the n most frequently used words, and prints out a sorted list of those words along with
their frequencies.

The problem is solved with a functional approach, i.e. by function composition. The original text is transformed to a
list of words, it is assigned a count to each word, and then words are sorted based on the number of times they appear
in the text.
